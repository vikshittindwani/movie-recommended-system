Movie Recommendation System

Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Jupyter Notebook for model development and Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface. It allows users to find personalized movie recommendations based on content similarity or collaborative filtering techniques.

Features

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to a given movie based on textual data like genre, cast, and plot.

Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user preferences and ratings.

Interactive UI with Streamlit: A clean and modern interface for easy movie search and recommendations.

Search Functionality: Users can search for a movie and get recommendations instantly.

Visualization: Charts and graphs to show trends in movie recommendations.

Installation

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. Install the required libraries using:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit requests beautifulsoup4
